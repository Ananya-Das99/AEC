    <h1>ADITYA ENGINEERING COLLEGE AT A GLANCE</h1>
    
    <p>
        Aditya Engineering College came into existence on the 15th day of
        November, 2006. It was an upgradation of Aditya College established
        in 1868, one of the oldest and largest colleges in India which
        subsequently became an autonomous college with CPE status by UGC and
        'A' grade by NAAC. The College with all its glorious academic
        achievement and ceaseless scholastic pursuits had already created a
        distinct niche for itself in India and beyond. The history of this
        great institution is, in a manner of speaking, the history of modern
        Orissa. It was the cradle of ideas fostering national unity and
        nationalism, promoting social mobilization and gearing up the freedom
        struggle.The grand hall of this institution was a theatre of history:
        on the 1st of April'1936 it was the venue for the declaration of
        Orissa as a separate province; thereafter it housed the state's first
        legislative assembly up to and even after Independence till it was
        shifted to Bhubaneswar, the new capital of the state. During Quit
        India Movement of 1942 the students of this institution brought down
        the Union Jack as a mark of nationalistic fervour.<br>
